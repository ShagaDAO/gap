> ### Context split (avoid confusion)
> - **Shaga Network usage stats (165k MAU, 200k+ hours)** refer to **classical game streaming** on Shaga – not neural codecs.
> - **NGC** is research toward neural codecs. We do **not** deploy NGC in production.
> - When we say "targets" (e.g., 2–5 Mbps, ≤50 ms): these are **engineering targets**, not measured results. See BENCHMARKS.md.
